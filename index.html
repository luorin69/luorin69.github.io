	<p> The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. </p>

			<p id = "important2"> I'm a college student attending <em> Western Colorado University. </em> I'm currently studying Graphic Design and plan on pursuing a career in that field. <br> Though my trajectory is focused on graphic design, most of my past work has been through different mediums such as ink, paint, or pencil. </p>

			<p> All the the following work was created within the timeframe of 2021-2023. <br>
